(* When in a semantic patch there is f(X) ... f(X) we want to force
 * the two X to be equal in the concrete code, but we would like that
 * there be equal modulo some isomorphisms, so that the following
 * concrete code also match: f(a && b) g(); f(b && a)

 * Maybe would be easier to transform ast_c in ast_cocci and call the
 * iso engine of julia. *)
