(*****************************************************************************)
(* The AST C related types *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(*
 * Some stuff are tagged semantic: which means that they are computed
 * after parsing.
 *
 * This means that some elements in this AST are present only if
 * some annotation/transformation has been done on the original AST returned
 * by the parser. Cf type_annotater, comment_annotater, cpp_ast_c, etc.
 *)


(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(* Token/info *)
(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* To allow some transformations over the AST, we keep as much information
 * as possible in the AST such as the tokens content and their locations.
 * Those info are called 'info' (how original) and can be tagged.
 * For instance one tag may say that the unparser should remove this token.
 *
 * Update: Now I use a ref! in those 'info' so take care.
 * That means that modifications of the info of tokens can have
 * an effect on the info stored in the ast (which is sometimes
 * convenient, cf unparse_c.ml or comment_annotater_c.ml)
 *
 * convention: I often use 'ii' for the name of a list of info.
 *
 * Sometimes we want to add something at the beginning or at the end
 * of a construct. For 'function' and 'decl' we want to add something
 * to their left and for 'if' 'while' et 'for' and so on at their right.
 * We want some kinds of "virtual placeholders" that represent the start or
 * end of a construct. We use fakeInfo for that purpose.
 * To identify those cases I have added a fakestart/fakeend comment.
 *
 * cocci: Each token will be decorated in the future by the mcodekind
 * of cocci. It is the job of the pretty printer to look at this
 * information and decide to print or not the token (and also the
 * pending '+' associated sometimes with the token).
 *
 * The first time that we parse the original C file, the mcodekind is
 * empty, or more precisely all is tagged as a CONTEXT with NOTHING
 * associated. This is what I call a "clean" expr/statement/....
 *
 * Each token will also be decorated in the future with an environment,
 * because the pending '+' may contain metavariables that refer to some
 * C code.
 *
 *)

(* for unparser: *)

   * are used to be able to use '=' to compare big ast portions.

and il = info list

(* wrap2 is like wrap, except that I use it often for separator such
 * as ','. In that case the info is associated to the argument that
 * follows, so in 'a,b' I will have in the list [(a,[]); (b,[','])].
 *
 * wrap3 is like wrap, except that I use it in case sometimes it
 * will be empty because the info will be included in a nested
 * entity (e.g. for Ident in expr because it's inlined in the name)
 * so user should never assume List.length wrap3 > 0.

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* was called 'ident' before, but 'name' is I think better
 * as concatenated strings can be used not only for identifiers and for
 * declarators, but also for fields, for labels, etc.
 *
 * Note: because now the info is embedded in the name, the info for
 * expression like Ident, or types like Typename, are not anymore
 * stored in the expression or type. Hence if you assume this,
 * which was true before, you are now wrong. So never write code like
 * let (unwrape,_), ii = e  and use 'ii' believing it contains
 * the local ii to e. If you want to do that, use the appropriate
 * wrapper get_local_ii_of_expr_inlining_ii_of_name.

(* C Type *)
(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(* Could have more precise type in fullType, in expression, etc, but
 * it requires to do too much things in parsing such as checking no
 * conflicting structname, computing value, etc. Better to separate
 * concern. So I put '=>' to mean what we would really like. In fact
 * what we really like is defining another fullType, expression, etc
 * from scratch, because many stuff are just sugar.
 *
 * invariant: Array and FunctionType have also typeQualifier but they
 * don't have sense. I put this to factorise some code. If you look in
 * the grammar, you see that we can never specify const for the array
 * itself (but we can do it for pointer) or function, we always
 * have in the action rule of the grammar a { (nQ, FunctionType ...) }.
 *
 *
 * Because of ExprStatement, we can have more 'new scope' events, but
 * rare I think. For instance with 'array of constExpression' there can
 * have an exprStatement and a new (local) struct defined. Same for
 * Constructor.
 *

     * fail.

(* Note [Parsing #if guards]
 *
 * What I wanted to do:
 * The lexer should tokenize the #if guard, we use the TDefEOL-trick to
 * mark the end of the guard, and finally we add a rule to the ocamlyacc
 * parser.
 *
 * Problem:
 * The [lookahead] pass in [Parsing_hacks] assumes that an #if header is
 * a single token. The above solution breaks that assumption. So, when an
 * #if appears in some weird position, [lookahead] will comment out the #if
 * token, but not any subsequent token of the guard. It seems doable to
 * modify [lookahead] to handle this new situation, but this seems a complex
 * and delicate function to touch, and (who knows) we may break something
 * else. Also note that [TCommentCpp] only takes one [info], so we would
 * need to combine all the [info]s of an #if into one.
 *
 * What I finally did:
 * The safest way I found is to save the #if guard in the [TIfdef] token as
 * a (yet-to-be-parsed) string. This is enough to reason about, or match
 * against, simple and most-common #ifdef and #ifndef conditionals. (Rough
 * estimate: 80% of #if conditionals in Linux are #if[n]def.) But the
 * AST for #if guards can still be easily obtained by traversing the syntax
 * tree with a parsing function.
