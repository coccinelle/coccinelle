(*
 * There is more information in the CFG we build that in the CFG usually built
 * in a compiler. This is because:
 *
 *  - We need later to go back from flow to original ast, because we are
 *    doing a refactoring tool, so different context. So we have to add
 *    some nodes for '{' or '}' or goto that normally disappear in a CFG.
 *    We must keep those entities, in the same way that we must keep the parens
 *    (ParenExpr, ParenType) in the Ast_c during parsing.
 *
 *    Moreover, the coccier can mention in his semantic patch those entities,
 *    so we must keep those entities in the CFG.
 *
 *    We also have to add some extra nodes to make the process that goes from
 *    flow to ast deterministic with for instance the CaseNode, or easier
 *    with for instance the Fake node.
 *
 *  - The coccinelle engine later transforms some nodes, and we need to rebuild
 *    the ast from a statement now defined and altered in different nodes.
 *    So we can't just put all the parsing info (Ast_c.il) in the top node of
 *    a statement. We have to split those Ast_c.il in different nodes, to
 *    later reconstruct a full Ast_c.il from different nodes. This is why
 *    we need the Else node, ...
 *
 *    Note that at the same time, we also need to store the fullstatement
 *    in the top node, because the CTL engine need to get that information
 *    when dealing with MetaStatement (statement S; in a Semantic Patch).
 *
 *
 *  - The CTL engine needs more information than just the CFG, and we use
 *    tricks to encode those information in the nodes:
 *
 *       - We have some TrueNode, FalseNode to know in what branch we are.
 *         Normally we could achieve this by putting this information in the
 *         edges, but CTL engine know nothing about edges, it must do
 *         everything with only nodes information.
 *
 *       - We need to mark each braces with an identifier so that the CTL
 *         can know if one specific '}' correspond to a specific '{'.
 *
 *       - We add some labels to each node to handle the MetaRuleElem and
 *         MetaStatement. It allows to groups nodes that belong to the same
 *         statement. Normally CFG are there to abstract from this, but in
 *         Coccinelle we need sometimes the CFG view, and sometimes the Ast
 *         view and the labels allow that.
 *
 *       - We even add nodes. We add '}', not only to be able to go back to AST
 *         but also because of the CTL engine. So one '}' may in fact be
 *         represented by multiple nodes, one in each CFG path.
 *
 *       - need After,
 *       - need FallThrough.
 *       - Need know if ErrorExit,
 *
 * choice: Julia proposed that the flow is in fact just
 * a view through the Ast, which means just Ocaml ref, so that when we
 * modify some nodes, in fact it modifies the ast. But I prefer do it
 * the functional way.
 *
 * The node2 type should be as close as possible to Ast_cocci.rule_elem to
 * facilitate the job of cocci_vs_c.

  (* For CTL to work, we need that some nodes loop over itself. We
   * need that every nodes have a successor. Julia also want to go back
   * indefinitely. So must tag some nodes as the beginning and end of
   * the graph so that some fix_ctl function can easily find those
   * nodes.
   *
   * If have a function, then no need for EndNode; Exit and ErrorExit
   * will play that role.
   *
   * When everything we analyze was a function there was no pb. We used
   * FunHeader as a Topnode and Exit for EndNode but now that we also
   * analyse #define body, so we need those nodes.

   (* flow_to_ast: cocci: Need the { and } in the control flow graph also
    * because the coccier can express patterns containing such { }.
    *
    * ctl: to make possible the forall (AX, A[...]), have to add more than
    * one node sometimes for the same '}' (one in each CFG path) in the graph.
    *
    * ctl: Morover, the int in the type is here to indicate to what { }
    * they correspond. Two pairwise { } share the same number. kind of
    * "brace_identifier". Used for debugging or for checks and more importantly,
    * needed by CTL engine.
    *
    * Because of those nodes, there is no equivalent for Compound.
    *
    * There was a problem with SeqEnd. Some info can be tagged on it
    * but there is multiple SeqEnd that correspond to the same '}' even
    * if they are in different nodes. Solved by using shared ref
    * and allow the "already-tagged" token.

  (* Used to mark the end of if, while, dowhile, for, switch. Later we
   * will be able to "tag" some cocci code on this node.
   *
   * This is because in
   *
   * - S + foo();
   *
   * the S can be anything, including an if, and this is internally
   * translated in a series of MetaRuleElem, and the last element is a
   * EndStatement, and we must tag foo() to this EndStatement.
   * Otherwise, without this last common node, we would tag foo() to 2
   * nodes :( So having a unique node makes it correct, and in
   * flow_to_ast we must propagate back this + foo() to the last token
   * of an if (maybe a '}', maybe a ';')
   *
   * The problem is that this stuff should be in transformation.ml,
   * but need information available in flow_to_ast, but we don't want
   * to polluate both files.
   *
   * So the choices are
   *
   * - soluce julia1, extend Ast_c by adding a fake token to the if
   *
   * - extend Ast with a Skip, and add this next to EndStatement node,
   * and do special case in flow_to_ast to start from this node
   * (not to get_next EndStatement, but from EndStatement directly)
   * and so add a case when have directly a EndStatement node an extract
   * the statement from it.
   *
   * - remonter dans le graphe pour accrocher le foo() non plus au
   * EndStatement (qui n'a pas d'equivalent niveau token dans l'ast_c),
   * mais au dernier token de la branche Else (ou Then si y'a pas de else).
   *
   * I first did solution 2 and then when we decided to use ref,
   * I use julia'as solution. Have virtual-placeholders, the fakeInfo
   * for the if, while, and put this shared ref in the EndStatement.
