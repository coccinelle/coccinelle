  for noticing the need for them.
- Allow multiple position variables per token
- ++ can now be associated with - code
- Allow /* */ comments as smpl comments, not only as + code

- Multicharacter command-line options now begin with -- and contain -
  rather than _.
- Allow multiple types of hidden metavariables, each preceded by @.
  Position variables can be attached to these.
- Python code now receives a structure containing a list of matched
  elements for list metavariables.  Thanks to Michael Stefaniuc for
  suggesting this features.
- Python code now receives expressions and identifiers as ordinary strings,
  not as elements of specific structures.
- Allow size_t as the type of an array index in smpl code.  Reported by
  Mansour Moufid.

** Features:
- Preserve spacing before // comments when not at the beginning of a line
- Adjusted parsing of endif to put it after jump code
- Improve warning message when using -use_cache
- More helpful initial value for exported variables in python
- Support - on expression nests
- Better handling of the case of a matched declaration that should only
  be replaced by other top level things.
- Allow a semantic patch beginning and ending with braces to match the
  complete body of a function if the braces are not removed and if nothing
  is added before the first brace or after the last one.
- Add -cache_prefix option, to specify where to put cached files.
- Allow module_init(foo); to match module_init(foo) (or likewise for any
  declarer), when no transformation is specified on the semicolon.

  index (parallelism), if any.
- Allow multi-character constants in C code and SmPL code.  Thanks to Kamil
  Pilch for pointing out the problem.
- Better parsing of K&R C functions.  No longer convert all parameters to
  typedefs.
- Implement newes as a hash table, for more efficiency on big sets of
  environments.
- A local variable that is declared without a type is not considered to be
  a local variable.  Actually, such a variable is probably really a macro
  that expends to a declaration, and this macro is not the variable name.

  inplace.
- -debug gives information about defined virtual rules and about virtual
  identifier bindings.
- no more crashing on c++-like code without the c++ argument.

  coccinelle if possible.
- The installed 'bin/spatch' calls spatch.opt or spatch with default parameters
  for iso/headers/python. 'bin/spatch.opt' and 'bin/spatch.byte'
- The bundled packages are now in the 'bundles' subdirectory and in the
  form of their original tarballs. These are extracted and used on-demand.
- Compatibility with python 2 and python 3. Also, a small bug is fixed in the order
  of library includes that caused sometimes trouble when building the pycaml library.
- Dropped the dependency on Perl in the Makefiles
- The configure script uses pkg-config and ocaml findlib and provides many
  flags for tuning/overriding the build process (including the ocaml
  compiler and the C compiler and preprocessor).
- Add line number directives to the .ml file generated from a .cocci file
- Added 'make check' as an alternative to 'make test'. It can run after
  building spatch, checks whether some features work (python and ocaml scripts,
  regexes) if these features are enabled, and then launches the test suite
  with a 75% success rate requirement. It also does not ask for user input
  and can be used in autonomous builds.
- Added an experimental --reverse flag to invert the semantic patch before application.
  Note that not all patches can be inverted, nor is it guaranteed that applying
  a patch followed by applying its inverse is an identity operation.
- Cache prefix takes distribution index into account.
- Add --defined and --undefined options allowing some code not to be
  touched.  Suggested by Eric Leblond.
- Dropped the need for the ocaml-extlib and ocaml-sexplib packages.
- Changed the file format of the regression test results. Files in the old format
  are no longer readable by spatch.

  coccinelle, using positions to connect them together. This is an experimental
  feature. See demos/external_ana.{c,cocci,data}.

  performance.  Thanks to Johannes Berg for the suggestion.
- Allow multidecls when removing variable names or when modifying type.
- Take fresh declarations into account when computing get_constants to
  create dependencies
- Leave ifdefs-like directives in unparsed code, if they don't have
  beginning or ending counterparts.
- Improved interpret_cocci_grep to try to avoid no accumulating lots of
  anded data.
- Improve type inference performance when many files included by using
  maps.
- Extend file names only if the mentioned file does not exist.
- Better support for functions that have no specified return type.
- Added --include-headers-for-types option.

- For get_constants, virtuals should be false, not true
- C parsing of top-level declarers with initializations.
- Remove constraints in predicates in match result, to avoid PCRE equality
  problems

- Better spacing for generated argument lists.  Thanks to Lars-Peter Clausen
  for reporting the problem.
- Collect all module interfaces for ocaml scripting in a single
  coccilib.cmi file, with the list of exposed internal modules in
  ocaml/exposed_modules.ml. This simplifies the installation of the
  ocaml version of coccilib, and allows us to specify which modules
  can be accessed by an ocaml script. The coccilib.cmi must either
  reside in $COCCI_DIR/ocaml/ or $COCCI_DIR/ocaml/coccilib/.
- Ocamlbuild-based compilation of coccinelle (experimental). In a
  cleaned repository, use the configure option --enable-ocamlbuild to
  enable it. The Makefiles will then use ocamlbuild.
- Ocamlscripts can access more of coccinelle: the file
  ocaml/exposed_modules.ml specifies which modules are accessible.

  C code.  Thanks to SF Markus Elfring for pointing out the problem.
- Allow an expression list metavariable to be attached to a parameter list
  metavariable, to allow using the parameter names as an argument list.
  Thanks to Michael Stefaniuc for pointing out the need for this feature.
- register x; in C is considered to implicitly declare an int typed
  variable.  A type metavariable that is part of a match of this
  declaration will get bound to int.  But if the type metavariable
  furthermore is associated with a position metavariable, the match will
  fail, because the implicit int has no position.  Thanks to Nic Volanschi
  for pointing out the problem.
- Propagate parameter list variables from rules for function definitions
  to the generated rules for function prototypes.  Thanks to Nic Volanschi
  for pointing out the problem.

- Allow renaming types in multidecls, including renames in initializers.
- Save virtual identifiers from the command line for use in finalize code.
- Make ocaml file prefix name be just a constant string rather than being
  determined by the semantic patch file name, to avoid
  incompatabilities between the semantic patch file name and what is
  allowed for the names of ocaml modules.  Thanks to Markus Elfring for
  noticing the problem.
- Improved use of parsing_hacks when an item of interest is preceded by
  a #define or #undef.  Thanks to Nic Volanschi for finding the problem.

  finding the problem.
- Try to improve column offsets in complex strings.

  get_constants.  Also removing constraints based on plus information
  results in True, regardless on whether & or v is being considered.
  Thanks to Luis R. Rodriguez for reporting the problem.
- Move pcre regular expressions to a hashtable, and out of parsed smpl
  terms to avoid problems with comparing rule_elems in ctl matching.

  work on only one semantic patch per execution of Coccinelle.  Thanks to
  SF Markus Elfring for pointing out the problem.
- Leave constraints in function prototypes, now that they are comparable.
- Make it possible to add something after the last brace of a function.

  dropped or not match any code.  Thanks to Stefan Assmann for reporting
  the problem.
- Manage trailing comma in Constructor code.  Thanks to Viresh Kumar for
  noting the problem.
- For multidecls, take into account that type may comprise multiple tokens.
  Thanks to Nic Volanschi for noticing the problem.
- don't add newlines in #defines, even if lines get long
- consider # as a comment character in script code
- Don't take into account string constants in get_constants, as these are
  not likely to be indexed.  Thanks to Benoit Taine for noting the problem.
- Better pretty printing indentation for ifs.
- Don't multiply propagate positions to the same token in isos that use the
  same token more than once.  Problem reported by Riccardo Lucchese.

  plus code is put, and thus formatting of output.
- Put newlines only after certain Tokens in unparse_cocci.

* 0.2.5

- no lubtype on arguments of && and || in SmPL
- allow unknown as type for array indices in SmPL
- support matching of static annotation on functions that are both static
  and inline
- support ENOTDIR error in Common.lfile_exists, to allow for the case where
  an include file is in a subdirectory that exists but is an ordinary file,
  not a directory.
- better management of unbound position variables that appear in
  constraints
- cause python parser to skip over // comments, hoping that // is not
  meaningful inside python
- require + on every line of a multiline comment
- correct calculation of line numbers when there is script code
- always annotate arguments of && || and ! as test expressions in C code.

* 0.2.1
** Language:
- Add virtual identifiers
- Add coccilib.report and coccilib.trac Python modules
- coccilib.org and coccilib.report are imported by default but not loaded
  in the current scope.

** Features:
- Parse_error_msg now more helpful.  New option -verbose_parsing for even
  more information.
- Improve Python import handling. They are imported once during script
  initialization.

** Bugfix:
- correct treatment of depends on with || for virtual rules

* 0.2.0
** Language:

** Features:
- Remove duplicated code in disjunctions
- Better error message when grep finds nothing relevant.  Thanks to Joe
  Perches for the suggestion.
- added -keep_comments option for the unparsing of the transformed code
- Option "-version" now also gives information about built-in
  Python binding support.
- slightly faster environment manipulation in pathological cases
- hack added to accept well-formed #define after function header

** Bugfix:
- Proper consideration of #define macro arguments in checking for the use
  of metavariables and in computing the line numbers of complex terms
- Better parsing of included .cocci files
- Put included .cocci files in the right order
- Bind position variables only once for #include
- Fix bug in include_match that caused everything to halt when all matches
  were discarded
- Merge unlikely/likely iso rules under a iso rule named unlikely
- Some fixes to coccicheck rules, thanks to Andrew Lunn
- Support groups in regular expression, thanks to Michael Stefaniuc

* 0.1.11

** Language:
- Meta-identifier/function and constant could be filtered from SmPL by
  regular expressions using the "~=" and "!~=" operators followed by
  an OCaml regular expression (see man Str) in double quote.
- Virtual rules, which can be referenced in depends, and set and unset
  using the command-line options -D
- ++ for multiple additions

** Features:
- coccicheck: a framework to check a series of SmPL files on a project
  see scripts/coccicheck for more information

** Bugfix:
- bind position variables to the correct starting position in the case of a
  complex statement such as an if or while.  Thanks to Derek Jones for
  pointing out the problem.
- checking for non mentioned case lines in switch should be unchecked.
- space should be printed after sizeof when there are no parentheses around
  the argument.  Thanks to Daniel Walker for pointing out the problem.
- avoid introducing sharing in propagating ! over () in treatment of isos
- save_excursion has to handle and rethrow exceptions

- made python integration more like the ubuntu version
  http://patches.ubuntu.com/by-release/extracted/debian/c/coccinelle/0.1.5dbs-2/01-system-pycaml
  this fixes some memory management problems with None, True, and False
- correct labels associated with a switch in the CFG so that a statement
  metavariable can match a switch.  Thanks to Derek Jones for pointing out
  the problem.
- keep switch pattern within switch body.  Thanks to Derek Jones for
  pointing out the problem.
- Allow expanded tokens to be stored in metavariables, as long as they are
  not removed.  But this does currently allow them in + code, which will
  produce the expansion.  Thanks to Ali-Erdem Ozcan for pointing out the
  problem.
- improved adjustment of spacing when code removed at the beginning of a line

* 0.1.9

** Language:
- allow fresh identifiers to be declared using ## such that the value mixes
  both strings and previously declared metavariables

  Thanks to Nicholas Mc Guire for pointing out the problem.
- more precise warning message related to ifdefization.
  Thanks to Derek Jones for pointing out the problem.
- we don't create any more certain files in /tmp (they may be a cause
  of security problems).
  Thanks to Eugeniy Meshcheryakov for pointing out the problem.

  Allows this to happen without tracing through all the control-flow
  paths.  Thanks to Francois Bissyande for pointing out the problem.
- prevent code from being added to the beginning or end of a disjunction
- more information about why a script is not applied when using -debug option
- added -no_safe_expressions option
- added -no_loops option.  Ignores back edges derived from looping
  constructs.  This is unsafe, but perhaps useful for bug finding, as it can
  be more efficient.
- for semantic matches, allow "minus" on same code with multiple
  environments
- better error message for mismatch of parenthesis in column 0 with normal
  parenthesis.  Thanks to Derek Jones for pointing out the problem.
- allow disjunctions on function return types.  Thanks to Pierre Habouzit
  for pointing this out.

** Bugfix:
- keep disjunction in the proper order for structure initialization fields
- variables declared in different places should not seem to match each
  other
- drop complaints about label metavariables not being used
- drop test information from the type of an expression when the expression
  is bound to a metavariable
- nests should not extend beyond the before and after code, even if the
  before and after code matches the nest code
- nests should extend into conditionals that end in error exit
- take into account metavariables on "else".  Thanks to Derek Jones for
  pointing out the problem.
- print single quotes on generated character constants

- adjusted spacing within generated code
- less verbose -sp.  Thanks to Derek Jones for pointing out the problem.
- accept multiple type names in a SmPL typedef declaration.

* 0.1.8

** Language:

** Features:
- Metavariables now capture the cpp code contained within their definitions
- When - fragments are separated by ... or nest boundaries in the semantic
  patch, but end up matching adjacent source code, the comments, cpp code
  and whitespace that are between them are not deleted.
- better parsing of C: do expansion of macros only when needed when
  have actually a parse error and also leverage the definition of macros
  in the parsed file (or in a optional_standard.h file passed as a parameter).
  This should reduce the need for many hardcoded definitions in standard.h
- new semantics for the -macro_file option, by default now expand macros
  only when necessary. To force use the -macro_file_builtins option instead.
- a new -extract_macros command line action to help the parser. Works with
  the -macro_file option. e.g. 
    $ ./spatch -extract_macros ~/linux > /tmp/alldefs.h
    $ ./spatch -macro_file /tmp/alldefs.h -sp_file foo.cocci -dir ~/linux
- removed -D macro_file option, not consistent with what -D usually means
- reattempt to be more efficient for statement metavariables that are just
  placeholders (ie, no modification, no reuse)
- triples now returned from ctl in sorted order.  The main key is the
  state.  On the other hand, the state order does not always agree with the
  order of appearance in the code.
- spatch is now less verbose on the things it does yet handle. Less confusing
  for new users.
- slightly better error report. Thanks to Derek Jones for the suggestion.
- added the options -linux_spacing and -smpl_spacing.  -linux_spacing
  causes spatch to follow the spacing conventions of Linux, while
  -smpl_spacing causes spatch to follow the spacing in the semantic patch.
  -linux_spacing is the default.
- more informative error reporting for the already tagged token case.
  Thanks to Erik Hovland for the suggestion.

** Bugfix:
- better parsing of declare macro at toplevel and in structure. 
  cf -text xfield
- allowing back typedef names for fieldname
- better printing of else in generated code
- slightly better type inference for binary operators.
- clear out declarer names and iterator names between SmPL files (for
  -testall)
- better parsing and type checking of macro type aliases. Cf -test macro_int16.
  Thanks to Li Yingtong for pointing out the problem.
- make insert_virtual_positions tail rec, avoid stack overflow pb.
  Thanks to Diego Liziero <diegoliz@gmail.com> for pointing out the
  problem.
- Better type inference for arithmetic binary operators
  Thanks to Li Yingtong for pointing out the problem.
- Better type inference for constants
  Thanks to Li Yingtong for pointing out the problem.
- move computing of adjacency information for semantic patches to after
  application of isomorphisms, because isomorphisms can introduce "..."
- compute adjacency information for negated ...
- record with each transformation site the set of indices of the witness
  trees that caused the transformation site to come about.  Whitespace and
  comments between remove tokens associated with disjoint witness trees is
  not removed.
- correct treatment of function pointer typed parameters in the SmPL ast0
  visitor.
- better parsing error message and error recovery when comments are not ended, 
  when some macros have a weird body, and when some switch have a weird
  Body. 
  Thanks to Derek Jones for pointing out the problem.
- better detection and passing of "dangerous" ifdefs, cf -test
  double_switch.
- dropped the separation of decls and body in Seq.  This gives better
  positioning of the bindings of metavariables shared between them.
  Thanks to Erik Hovland for an example that shows the problem.

** Internals:
- suppress warning in compiling ocamlsexp (warning caused by a new behavior
  of cpp used internally in processing files in ocamlsexp/)

* 0.1.7

** Language: 
- initialize and finalize script code, cf demos/initial_final.cocci

** Features:
- -iso_limit option to limit the depth of isomorphism application
- with the dir option, the include path is implicitly set to the "include"
  subdirectory of the specified directory, if the option -I is not used.
- give a seed for the name of a fresh identifier
- better handling of cpp "constructed" identifiers as in a##b, that in
  the futur will make it easier to match over those idents. 
  cf tests/pb_parsing_macro.c. Thanks to Ali-Erdem Ozcan for pointing
  out the problem. A new "parsing hack hint" is also available:
  YACFE_IDENT_BUILDER, cf standard.h.

** Bugfix:
- drop excessive "optimization" in ctl generation for while and for loops
- allow . as the name of the directory
- for type inference for an assignment, take the type of the right-hand
  side expression, not the type of the assigned variable
- allow for with a declaration in the first header element, as in C++
  (partial support)
- allow for matching against variable declarations that include only
  storage, eg static, but no type at all.
- allow for matching against types that contain both short/long and int
- allow the type metavariable in the SmPL code "unsigned T" to match a T
  that is a type consisting of more than one word, eg long int.
- -ifdef_to_if option made to process nested ifdefs
  (partial support)

** Internals: 
- improve and fix installation process (usable on BSD)
- improve and fix testing process
- apply patches from Eugeniy Meshcheryakov
- reorganize the way we parse C identifiers, especially concatenated cpp 
  identifiers as in a##b. This may lead to some regressions as we may
  not parse as much code as before.

  Thanks to Flavien@lebarbe.net for the idea.
- the ability to print the values of more (but not all) kinds of
  metavariables from python
- new vim SmPL mode.
  Thanks to Alexander Faroy.

** Bugfix:
- consider the ident tokens also in the 2 lines before the error line for the 
  10-most-problematic-parsing-errors diagnostic.
- SmPL parser allows cast as the argument of a pointer
- SmPL type checker allows enum as an array index
- Better generation of fresh metavariables names in hrule
- no more warnings about things that should be metavariables when there is
  a disjunction in a function position
- bugfix in parser, better error message.
  Thanks to Ali-Erdem OZCAN <ali-erdem.ozcan@st.com> for the bug report.

** Features: 
- can match patterns of the form unsigned T or signed T, where T is a
  metavariable
- dropped the sizeof_parens isomorphism, which was made redundant by the
  paren isomorphism

** Bugfix:
- trailing , ; and ) no longer left on a line by themselves
- better treatment of error exit when the searched for code matches the
  error exit condition.
- fix incorrect treatment of parentheses in test_exps that could allow +
  code to be added twice
- don't ask whether iterator names and declarer names should be declared as
  metavariables.
- slightly better support for expression list metavariables.
- short and long allowed for array index types in SmPL

- changed order of printing const and volatile
- allow  eg ... <... in plus code
- better formatting of generated if/while/etc. code
- better parse error reporting when the problem is at the end of the file

** Internals: 
- isomorphisms don't apply under signed/unsigned, to prevent the creation
  of things like unsigned signed int.  Need a better solution for this.

* 0.1.3

** Features: 
- help in building the configuration macro file. The -parse_c action
  now returns the 10 most frequent parsing errors. This give useful
  hints to extend standard.h.
