# This script is used to find the xxdate.exe file needed by Hevea.
# It is needed because different distributions store it in different places:
# For Gentoo: /usr/lib64/hevea
# For Ubuntu family: /usr/share/hevea
# Etc.

# If the file is found, its absolute path is printed to stdout.
# Otherwise, a warning is printed on stderr and the script returns 1
