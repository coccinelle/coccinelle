Notes from Peter:

Python scripts inside .cocci files:
   ### Issue 1
   Recently I needed to extract the path from the .cocci from the python script
   for including a Python file using import. I needed to do something like:

   source_dir = abspath(dirname(cocci.cocci_file))

   This returns the directory correctly, but the Python way of doing it would
   be something like:

   source_dir = abspath(dirname(__file__))

   Similar issue, maybe related issue, happens when there is an error on the
   Python script. On the example below File contains "<string>", instead of
   the path to the .cocci file

[peter@hp-peter linux]$ spatch /tmp/test777.cocci .
init_defs_builtins: /usr/local/lib/coccinelle/standard.h
HANDLING: ./net/mac802154/tx.c
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 3, in <module>
NameError: name '__file__' is not defined
while running simple python string:
from coccinelle import *

print __file__
:
Failure in rule starting on line 6
Fatal error: exception Yes_pycocci.Pycocciexception

   ### Issue 2
   When using -j option python script errors are not displayed, instead,
   spatch only reports:

   [Parmap]: aborting due to exception on core 19: Yes_pycocci.Pycocciexception

   This is a problem as using only one core can lead to a long time to reach
   the corner case that is causing the error on the script
