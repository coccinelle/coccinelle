		Coccicheck version 0.2.4

 -*- Usage -*-

 1) ./configure mode <your project directory>
 	This will setup some default directories.
	Check in Makefile if they suit you!
	mode is either org or diff, depending on whether you want the
 	output in Emacs org mode, or in diff format where - indicates not
 	something to remove but an item of interest.

	NB: The project directory must currently be an absolute path.

	On bash, you can overwrite the default flags on the command line:
	SPFLAGS="-I my_include -timeout 30" ./configure mode <project>

 2) make update
 	This will create the `results` directory.
	It will contain all the files needed
	to apply the SmPL files to your project.

 3) make [-jX] (where X is the number of cores to use)
 	This will apply all the SmPL files found in
	the `cocci` directory to your project
	(as previously defined).

When it's done, you will get some "out" and "log" files in the
`results` directory. "out" files will contain the output generated by
the SmPL files, and the "log" files will contain the execution trace
of spatch.

If you edit/add some SmPL files in `cocci` directory, you can use
`make checkcocci` to parse them and see if there is any error.

Once the results are computed, you can either:
 - run `make viewres` to view all the bug reports
 - run `make viewlog` to view the complete execution trace
 - run `make viewfilteredlog` to only view unlikely errors of the trace 
	Note that this filter will remove some error messages about
	timeout, parsing ... Check Makefile to see the exact list.
