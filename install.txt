 ** Note **

- Parallel building is possible when you do not build the bytecode
  and native version of spatch simultaneously.

 ** Dependencies **

You must first install OCaml. Versions 4.08.0.-5.1.1 are supported.
See http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html

If your OCaml compiler has been configurated with --enable-flambda,
compiling the SmPL parser may take a very long time (34 minutes has been
reported).  This does not cause any problem for running the compiled code.
Flambda is known to be enabled with the version of OCaml distributed with
Fedora.  More information about flambda is available at
https://ocaml.org/manual/5.1/flambda.html

On Debian/Ubuntu, install the following packages:
 - automake
 - make
 - gcc (or any other C compiler)
 - pkg-config (optional, but strongly recommended)
 - ocaml-native-compilers (or alternatively ocaml)
 - ocaml-findlib
 - texlive-fonts-extra (for the documentation)
 - hevea (for the documentation)
 - menhir and libmenhir-ocaml-dev (optional, bundled)
 - libpython3-dev (or libpython2.7-dev) (optional, for Python scripting)
 - libparmap-ocaml-dev (optional, bundled)
    If you do not install libparmap-ocaml-dev, then you will automatically use
    the bundle instead. However, if you used opam to switch to a different
    version of OCaml, you must uninstall libparmap-ocaml-dev.
 - libpcre-ocaml-dev (optional, for PCRE support, bundled)
    If you do not install libpcre-ocaml-dev, then you will automatically use the
    bundle instead. However, in order for the bundle to work, you also need:
  - libpcre3-dev (optional, not bundled)
     Additionally, if you used opam to switch to a different version of OCaml and
     want PCRE support, then make sure you have libpcre-ocaml-dev uninstalled and
     libpcre3-dev installed, otherwise Coccinelle will not compile.

On Fedora, install the following packages:
 - automake
 - pkgconfig (optional, but strongly recommended)
 - chrpath
 - ocaml
 - ocaml-findlib
 - ocaml-findlib-devel
 - ocaml-ocamldoc
 - ocaml-menhir (optional, bundled)
 - ocaml-pcre-devel (optional, bundled)
    Note: if you used opam to switch to a different version of OCaml, installing
    ocaml-pcre-devel will make compilation impossible. Additionally, PCRE
    support and OCaml scripting will be impossible.
If you want Python scripting: Coccinelle is not compatible with Python 3.13,
which is the default on Fedora as of 2024-12-19. Consider switching to Python
3.12, for example.

On Arch Linux, install the following packages:
$ pacman -Syu pkg-config ocaml ocaml-findlib autoconf automake pcre make
as well as the C compiler of your choice.
Note: if you used opam to switch to a different version of OCaml, OCaml
scripting will be impossible.

As Fedora and Arch usually upgrade packages to the latest available version,
and because Coccinelle is not always compatible with the latest version of
OCaml, you may have no choice but to use opam to switch to an earlier version.

You can try to use the package manager of your distribution to install
the build dependencies. This is not guaranteed to work, as the
dependencies may change, but chances are it will help you. Some
examples:

$ apt-get build-dep coccinelle
$ dnf builddep coccinelle
$ yum builddep coccinelle

** Compilation **

Simply run:
 ./autogen
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

Using Flatpak will side-step any dependency issues mentioned above.
If you prefer using Flatpak, you can build it and install it using:

$ sudo flatpak-builder --force-clean --install \
  --install-deps-from=flathub --ccache --repo=_flatpak-repo/ \
  _flatpak-build/ extra/flatpak/fr.inria.Coccinelle.yaml

It will install the `spatch` program as `fr.inria.Coccinelle`. Use it with:

$ flatpak run fr.inria.Coccinelle --help

Configuration flags of interest (for the ./configure step):
--prefix                default: /usr/local
--disable-opt           build the bytecode version
--with-python=PATH      choose a specific python executable
--without-python        no python scripting
--disable-ocaml         no ocaml scripting
--disable-pcre-syntax   no pcre regexp syntax
                        version of spatch
See ./configure --help for more options




By default, 'make' will
build in release configuration (no debugging symbols, etc.). It
defaults to the optimized version, unless --disable-opt is given
to configure. You could use 'make opt-only' to compile the
optimized version only. Similarly, you can use 'make byte-only' for
the unoptimized version. 'make install' installs whichever version
was compiled.
You can also use 'make world' to compile the bytecode
and the optimized code version.

Make targets of interest:
opt-only, opt           compiles just the optimized version
byt-only, byte          compiles just the bytecode version
world                   compiles both + frontends + docs
all-release             compiles the optimized version + frontends + docs
all-dev                 compiles the bytecode version + frontends
all                     default target: alias for either byte or opt
all.opt                 compiles the optimized version + frontends
check                   run tests (note: not all tests are expected to succeed)

Note: The test target is intended for developers. In particular, you
      should not expect that every test will pass.

In order to use the OCaml scripting feature in SmPL, an extra file,
coccilib.cmi, is produced and installed in /usr/local/lib/coccinelle/ocaml
(or /usr/share/cocci/ocaml), which is needed for the compilation of OCaml
scripts.

By default, Coccinelle Makefile is silent and does not print fully the
commands that are executed. Compilation can be turned verbose with

    $ make VERBOSE=yes

 ** Bash integration **

 To have completion under Bash, you can execute the following command:

    $ make install-bash

 It will install the shell script 'scripts/spatch.bash_completion'
 by default in the directory pointed by
   pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion
 if available, or $datarootdir/bash-completion/completions otherwise.
 The directory can be overridden by passing --with-bash-completion=$DIR
 to ./configure.
 The option --without-bash-completion disables the script installation.

 You can manually copy that file elsewhere if you have a different
 bash_completion directory.



 ** Runtime dependencies **

 - Basic shell commands:
   - ls, cat, cp, mv, rm, grep, mkdir, find
 - Developer tool: diff


 ** Optional runtime dependencies **

 - To quickly apply the semantic patches
   - glimpse indexer

 - To use OCaml scripting feature in SmPL
   - ocaml-native-compilers or ocaml-nox
   - ocaml-findlib

 - To generate a PDF of the control flow graph with '--graphical-trace'
   - pdftk and graphviz (with PDF support)

If runtime tools are not in $PATH, paths to some
of them can be specified with 'configure' or via
commandline parameters to spatch.


 ** Dependencies for additional tools **

    git, pushd, popd, sed, diffstat, cpp

 ** Uninstall **

    To uninstall Coccinelle, you should use the following command
    $ make uninstall

    To also remove the bash completion script, run
    $ make uninstall-bash

 ** Enable ocaml debugging **

    $ echo "EXTRA_OCAML_FLAGS+=-g" >>Makefile.local
