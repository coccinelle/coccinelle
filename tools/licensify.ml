 * did not contain any legal header.
 * At that time, this script was used to add the headers during the
 * release process.
 *
 * In commit eec9ca2207c273 the header has been added to the
 * version-controlled iles (using the licensify-new.ml script)
 * so this licensify.ml script has become useless.
