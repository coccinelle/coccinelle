\\TODO ... 
%Some notes for later:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Implementation overview (showing module dependencies and the program flow).
%\item Extensive use of the AST0 visitor. Reason: abstracts away a lot of boilerplate code for accessing the components of the abstract syntax tree.
%\item Easy way to debug in \texttt{rule\_body.ml}: add \texttt{>> GT.add "debug msg" >>} in some function sequence.
%\item Generator types, in particular snapshot and the combiner type in rule body (which is probably the most complex part of the implementation).
%\item The generating mode flag: cannot be substituted for ignore patch or match since that option means that the plus and minus tree are not processed in the same way.
%\end{itemize}
