\subsection{Installation and uninstallation}
\textbf{To install}: You need to have \texttt{Coccinelle} and all its dependencies installed. You also need to have the \texttt{Coccinelle} source code available. By default, the \texttt{sgen} directory lies within the \texttt{Coccinelle} directory in \texttt{coccinelle/tools/sgen}\footnote{If you change this, you need to modify the \texttt{COCCIDIR} path in \texttt{source/Makefile} to point to the \texttt{Coccinelle} source code directory.}. From the \texttt{sgen} directory, do:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \texttt{make} to compile the program.
\item Run \texttt{make install}\footnote{If permission is denied, run it in superuser mode e.g. \texttt{sudo make install}, depending on your system.\label{sudo}} to install the program.
\item (Optional) Try out the program by running \texttt{sgen examples/tiny.cocci} or \texttt{sgen <path\_to\_your\_script>.cocci}.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{To uninstall}: From the \texttt{sgen} directory, do:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run \texttt{make uninstall}$^{\ref{sudo}}$. 
\end{enumerate}
\bigskip

\subsection{Running the program}
The most common usages are as follows, for a semantic patch file \texttt{foo.cocci} and an sgen config file \texttt{foo.config}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{sgen foo.cocci}: Generate the file with \texttt{foo.config} if it exists. If not, the program is run in interactive mode.
\item \texttt{sgen -{}-config foo.config foo.cocci}: Generate the file with \texttt{foo.config} as config file. The shorthand \texttt{-c} can be used instead of \texttt{-{}-config}.
\item \texttt{sgen foo.cocci -{}-interactive}: Run the program in interactive mode. The shorthand \texttt{-i} can be used instead of \texttt{-{}-interactive}.
\end{itemize}
Additional options:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{-{}-default}: Generates the file, entirely using default values, such as generic error messages, instead of user input. Can e.g. be used to quickly check the generated context rule(s).
\item \texttt{-o <filename>}: Saves the generated file to \texttt{<filename>} instead of printing it to standard output.
\item \texttt{-{}-no-output}: Generates the file, but doesn't output the result.
\item \texttt{-help, -{}-help}: Displays the list of options.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip

\subsection{User input}
When generating a script, \texttt{sgen} might need some extra information from the user. There are two kinds of information:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Preface}: information to go at the beginning of the script. Contains metainformation about the script such as description, author, etc. See the full list in section \ref{config}.
\item \textbf{Rule information}: rule-specific info, such as error messages that are output in \texttt{org} and \texttt{report} mode.
\end{itemize}
There are two ways of passing this information, interactive mode and configuration mode.
\bigskip

\subsubsection{Interactive mode\label{interact}}
In interactive mode, the program prompts the user for the information through the commandline. The user can then choose to save the information into an \texttt{sgen} config file, which can be further modified and reused in configuration mode.
\bigskip

\subsubsection{Configuration mode\label{config}}
In configuration mode, the program looks for an \texttt{sgen} config file to provide the needed information to generate the file. For \texttt{<file>}.cocci, the config file should be called \texttt{<file>}.config.\\\\
The user-specified attributes in the \textbf{preface} are, in no specific order ((r) means required):
\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{2.1cm}p{3.6cm}p{5.5cm}}
\textbf{Attribute name} & \textbf{Shorthand} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description}\\
\texttt{description} (r) & \texttt{d} & Single-value text & Describes what the Coccinelle script does.\\
\texttt{confidence} (r) & \texttt{c} & Low, Moderate, High & Confidence level for the script.\\
\texttt{authors} & \texttt{a} & Multi-value text & Authors of the script, including affiliation and license.\\
\texttt{url} & \texttt{u} & Single-value text & URL for the script.\\
\texttt{limitations} & \texttt{l} & Multi-value text & Limitations for the script.\\
\texttt{keywords} & \texttt{k} & Single-value text & Keywords for the script.\\
\texttt{options} & \texttt{o} & Single-value text &\texttt{spatch} options with which to run the script.\\
\texttt{comments} & \texttt{m} & Single-value text & Additional comments.\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}\vspace{0.5cm}
The \textbf{rule information} contains error messages for \texttt{org} and \texttt{report}, and possibly rule names for rules that are unnamed in the original \texttt{Coccinelle script}.\\\\
\clearpage
\noindent The syntax for the \texttt{sgen} config files is rather simple, and the easiest way to learn it is to run \texttt{sgen} in interactive mode and study the resulting config. But for completeness ...:
\begin{itemize}
\item The syntax for attributes is
\begin{verbatim}
 <attribute_name> = <value>
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{<attribute\_name>} can be either the attribute name or its shorthand. The end of \texttt{<value>} is marked by a newline. It is therefore not possible to insert newlines in any of the values.
\item For multi-valued attributes, values are delimitered by pipes, \texttt{|}, ie.
\begin{verbatim}
<attribute_name> = <value_1>|<value_2>|...|<value_n>
\end{verbatim}
\item Error messages for rules follow the syntax
\begin{verbatim}
<rule_name> =
  org:<message>
  report:<message>
\end{verbatim}
for \texttt{org} and \texttt{report} error messages, respectively. Here, \texttt{<rule\_name>} is either the actual rule name, or, if it is a nameless rule, \texttt{<line\_that\_rule\_starts\_on>.<new\_name>}}.\newline
Meanwhile, \texttt{<message>} follow the syntax of \texttt{python} format strings, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
"This is a message that references two metavariables %s and %s." % (x,y)
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are metavariables in the rule. If using metavariables from another rule, write \texttt{<other\_rule\_name>.<metavar\_name>}. If using no metavariables, just write the error message surrounded by quotes.
\item Comments can be written in \texttt{c}-style, ie. \texttt{//} and \texttt{/**/}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples}
Example files (\texttt{Coccinelle} scripts, corresponding \texttt{sgen} config files, and \texttt{C} files to test on) can be found in the \texttt{examples} directory.
