Workflow:

main.ml: an entry point to be used in place of the cocci top level, to
check only the parsing of SmPL files.

parse_cocci.ml: Initiates the parsing process and subsequent processing
phases.  There are two entry points:

   process: called by main, returns metavariables and merged ast code

   process_for_ctl: called by engine/main, returns no metavariables, but
   instead ast and ast0 code.  ast code is used by ast0toctl for printing
   and ast0 code is transformed to CTL.
