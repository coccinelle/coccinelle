        Version 0.9.8 contains the following major new features w.r.t. 0.9.4
           - a chunksize parameter can be used to control the granularity of the
             parallelism: each worker will handle a series of chunks of this size
             and ask for them when ready, thus allowing the system to achieve
             automatic load balancing
           - very specialised versions of the map function are now available for
             arrays and float arrays, allowing to obtain significant speed-up even
             on relatively light computations
           - autoconf and ocamlbuild harness should simplify compilation and installation.

        internally convert lists to array to avoid quadratic penalty in execution time on long lists,
        thanks to Paul Vernaza <pvernaza@andrew.cmu.edu> for pointing out this issue;
        added 'a sequence type to allow using efficiently the library both with lists and arrays.
