This code started as a two day exercise done at Irill in July 2011, by 
Marco Danelutto <marcod@di.unipi.it> and Roberto Di Cosmo <roberto@dicosmo.org>,
that produced the architecture now contained in simplemapper.

It has evolved significantly after, and it now contains a particularly efficient
version of the map code on float arrays, incorporating ideas from Paul Vernaza
<pvernaza@andrew.cmu.edu>, and that works thanks to smart code and significant
insight from Jerome Vouillon <Jerome.Vouillon@pps.jussieu.fr>.

Pietro Abate <Pietro.Abate@pps.jussieu.fr> provided autoconf and ocamlbuild support.
