REQUIREMENTS

You need Objective Caml 3.09 or later and GNU make.

HOW TO INSTALL

If you wish to install via ocamlfind, make sure that ocamlfind is in
your PATH. (Remember that prefixing a command with sudo affects its
PATH.)

Run the following command:

  make PREFIX=/usr/local install

If your machine does not have the native code Objective Caml compiler
(ocamlopt), but does have the bytecode compiler (ocamlc), then instead
of the above command, use:

  make PREFIX=/usr/local TARGET=byte all install

The value of the PREFIX variable can be changed to control where
the software, the standard library, and the documentation should
be stored. These files are copied to the following places:

  $PREFIX/bin/
  $PREFIX/share/menhir/
  $PREFIX/doc/menhir/

The support library, MenhirLib, is either installed via ocamlfind, if
available, or placed within $PREFIX/share/menhir. Menhir's --suggest
options help determine where and how it was installed.

The documentation includes a reference manual and a number of demos.
