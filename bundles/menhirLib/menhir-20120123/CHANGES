2012/01/23:

Fixed a bug whereby a %nonassoc declaration was not respected. This
declaration requests that a shift/reduce conflict be reduced in favor of
neither shifting nor reducing, that is, a syntax error must occur. However,
due to an unforeseen interaction with the "default reduction" mechanism, this
declaration was sometimes ignored and reduction would take place.

2012/01/09:
Changes in the (undocumented) Coq back-end so as to match the ESOP 2012
paper.

2011/10/19:
The Makefile now tests whether Unix or Windows is used (the test is performed
by evaluating Sys.os_type under ocaml) and changes a couple settings accordingly:
- the executable file name is either menhir or menhir.exe
- the object file suffix is either .o or .obj

2011/10/19:
Added --strict, which causes many warnings about the grammar and about the
automaton to be considered errors.

2011/10/19:
The # annotations that are inserted in the generated .ml file now retain their
full path. (That is, we no longer use [Filename.basename].) This implies that
the # annotations depend on how menhir is invoked -- e.g.  "menhir
foo/bar.mly" and "cd foo && menhir bar.mly" will produce different
results. Nevertheless, this seems reasonable and useful (e.g. in conjunction
with ocamlbuild and a hierarchy of files). Thanks to Daniel Weil.

2011/10/06:
With the -lg 1 switch, Menhir now indicates whether the grammar is SLR(1).

2011/05/24:
Removed the lock in ocamldep.wrapper. It is the responsibility of the user
to avoid interferences with other processes (or other instances of the script)
that create and/or remove files.

2011/04/28:
The (internal) computation of the automaton's invariant was broken and has
been fixed. Surprisingly, this does not seem to affect the generated code,
(which was correct,) so no observable bug is fixed. Hopefully no bug is
introduced!

2011/04/07:
The grammar description files (.mly) are now read in up front and stored in
memory while they are parsed. This allows us to avoid the use of pos_in and
seek_in, which do not work correctly when CRLF conversion is being performed.

2011/04/05:
Fixed a bug in the type inference module (for parameterized non-terminals)
which would cause an infinite loop.

2011/01/24:
Fixed a bug that would cause an assertion failure in the generated parser
in some situations where the input stream was incorrect and the grammar
involved the error token. The fix might cause grammars that use the error
token to behave differently (hopefully more accurately) as of now.

2009/06/18:
Makefile changes: build and install only the bytecode version of menhirLib
when TARGET=byte is set.

2009/02/06:
Fixed ocamldep.wrapper to avoid quoting the name of the ocaml command.
This is hoped to fix a compilation problem under MinGW.

2009/02/04:
A Makefile fix to avoid a problem under Windows/Cygwin.
Renamed the ocaml-check-version script so as to avoid a warning.

2008/09/05:
Ocaml summer project: added --interpret, --table, and --suggest-*.

2008/08/06:
Fixed a problem that would cause the code inliner to abort when a semantic
value and a non-terminal symbol happened to have the same name.

2008/08/06:
Removed code sharing.

2008/06/20:
Removed an incorrect assertion that caused failures (lr1.ml, line 134).

2007/12/05:
Disabled code sharing by default, as it is currently broken. (See Yann's
message; assertion failure at runtime.)

2007/12/01:
Added an optimization to share code among states that have identical
outgoing transition tables.

2007/08/30:
Small Makefile change: create an executable file for check-ocaml-version in
order to work around the absence of dynamic loading on some platforms.

2007/05/20:
Made a fundamental change in the construction of the LR(1) automaton
in order to eliminate a bug that could lead to spurious conflicts --
thanks to Ketti for submitting a bug report.

2007/05/18:
Added --follow-construction to help understand the construction of the
LR(1) automaton (very verbose).

2007/05/11:
Code generation: more explicit qualifications with Pervasives so as
to avoid capture when the user redefines some of the built-in operators,
such as (+).
Added a new demo (calc-param) that shows how to use %parameter.

2007/03/22:
Makefile improvements (check for PREFIX; bootstrap in bytecode now
also available). Slight changes to OMakefile.shared.

2007/02/15:
Portability fix in Makefile and Makefile.shared (avoided "which").

2006/12/15:
Portability fix in Makefile.shared (replaced "&>" with "2>&1 >").

2006/06/23:
Made a slight restriction to Pager's criterion so as to never introduce
fake conflict tokens (see Lr0.compatible). This might help make conflict
explanations more accurate in the future.

2006/06/16:
Fixed bug that would cause positions to become invalid after %inlining.

2006/06/15:
Fixed --depend to be more lenient when analyzing ocamldep's output.
Added --raw-depend which transmits ocamldep's output unchanged (for
use in conjunction with omake).

2006/06/12:
Fixed bug that would cause --only-preprocess to print %token declarations
also for pseudo-tokens.
Fixed bug that caused some precedence declarations to be incorrectly
reported as useless.
Improved things so that useless pseudo-tokens now also cause warnings.
Fixed bug that would cause %type directives for terminal symbols to
be incorrectly accepted.
Fixed bug that would occur when a semantic action containing $i keywords
was %inlined.

2006/05/05:
Fixed problem that caused some end-of-stream conflicts not to be reported.
Fixed Pager's compatibility criterion to avoid creating end-of-stream conflicts.

2006/04/21:
Fixed problem that allowed generating incorrect but apparently well-typed
Objective Caml code when a semantic action was ill-typed and --infer was
omitted.

2006/03/29:
Improved conflict reports by factoring out maximal common derivation contexts.

2006/03/28:
Fixed bug that could arise when explaining a conflict in a non-LALR(1) grammar.

2006/03/27:
Changed count of reduce/reduce conflicts to allow a comparison with ocamlyacc's diagnostics.
When refusing to resolve a conflict, report all diagnostics before dying.

2006/03/18:
Added display of FOLLOW sets when using --log-grammar 2.
Added --graph option.
Fixed behavior of --depend option.

2006/01/06:
Removed reversed lists from the standard library.
